INTRODUCTION


Bitcoin is a network protocol that enables individuals to transfer property rights on account
units called "bitcoins", created in limited quantity. When an individual sends some bitcoins to
another individual, this information is broadcast to the peer-to-peer Bitcoin network. However,
for technical purposes we won’t address here, this transaction needs to be included – together
with other transactions forming a block – in the blockchain in order to be confirmed and secured.
As a consequence, the blockchain is a public ledger that contains the whole history of all
the transactions of bitcoins ever processed and all Bitcoin users can trust this decentralized,
distributed ledger.

It is the role of miners to do this work of confirming and securing transactions through
insertion in the blockchain. Practically and slightly simplifying, for any miner, this work consists
in considering a set of transactions that are present in the network, solving a mathematical
problem that depends on this set and spreading the result to the Bitcoin network for this solution
to be checked and for it to reach consensus. Once all these steps are done successfully, the set of
transactions considered by the miner forms a block that is added on top of the blockchain. The
first miner to succeed in this process is rewarded in bitcoins for his useful work.

In the current implementation of Bitcoin, this reward comes from both an ex-nihilo creation of
some new bitcoins and some fees Bitcoin users can add to their transactions. Since some bitcoins
are created in the mining process and in order to control the monetary base, mining is made more
complex than it could be. And, since in a first approximation, the probability for each miner to
solve a mining problem depends on his computational power, the complexity of mining is made
proportional to the total computational power of all miners. More precisely, the complexity is dynamically adjusted so that a block solving – and hence a creation of bitcoins – occurs every
ten minutes in expectation. Once a block is inserted in the blockchain, the mathematical problem
faced by all miners are modified and we can consider that a fresh new speed game starts between
miners. Hence, the whole building of the blockchain can be considered as independent block
insertions from the miners’ point of view.

BACKGROUND TO BITCOIN MINING


Bitcoin mining Is a digital asset and a payment system invented by satoshi nakamoto. Nakamoto introduced the idea on 31 october 2008 to a crystography mailing list and releasd it as an open source software in 2009.There have been several high profile claims to identity  of satoshi nakamoto. However,none of them has provided proof beyond doubt that back up ther claims.
The system is peer to peer so transaction takes place directly, without an intermediary. These instructions are verified by network nodes and recorded in apublic distributed  ledger called the blockchain,which uses bitcoin as its unit account. Since the systemworks without a central repository or single administor,the US.treasury categorizes bitcoin as descentralized virtual currency.It is often called the firs crystocurrenc, although prior systems existed and it is described as descentralised digital currency.Bitcoin is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value. Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into a called public ledger. bitcoin mining has hardware which evolved dramatically since 2009.At first miners used central orocessing unit(CPU) to mine,but soon this wasnt fast enough and it bogged down the system resources of the host computer.Miners quickly moved on to using graphical processing unit(GPU) in computer graphics cards because they were able to hash data 50 to 100 times faster and consumed much less power per unit of work.
During the winter of 2011, a new industry sprung up with custom equipment that pushed the performance standards even higher.The first wave of this speciality bitcoin mining devices were easy to use.Bitcoin miners were based on field programmable gate array(FPGA) processors and attached to computer using a convenient.
